# Instagram Sales Automation - SaaS Product

## Overview

Our SaaS product helps businesses leverage Instagram comments to drive sales through automated engagement. By integrating with Meta’s developer platform, our application listens for comments on product-related Instagram posts, analyzes their intent, and sends personalized direct messages to potential buyers. This streamlines the process of identifying and engaging with high-interest users, increasing conversion rates and customer interaction.

## How It Works

Listening & Capturing Comments - The system uses Instagram’s comment webhook to receive real-time notifications whenever a user comments on a post.

AI-Powered Analysis - Utilizing the OpenAI API, the system analyzes comment text to assess its relevance and intent. This determines whether the user expresses interest in purchasing the product.

Automated Engagement - If a comment is deemed high-interest, the system sends a friendly and personalized direct message (DM) to the user, including a product link and potential discount incentives. - This feature is a work in progress as Instagram doesn't allow automated firs message DMs
